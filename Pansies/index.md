The most frustrating aspect of this book is its tendency to glorify one MC's passiveness while trivializing the other's agency in shaping his own destiny. Alfie, born into a blue-collar family in Northern England, was once a bully king in high school. He went on to study financial math at LSE and became an investment banker in London after graduation. Throughout the years, he faced romantic failures with two of his hipster best friends: Kitty, who helped him realize he was gay, and Greg, a wealthy trust fund baby who was only sexually attracted to Alfie. Discovering his homosexuality triggered an identity crisis for Alfie, as he had already internalized heteronormativity.

On the other hand, Fen seemed to be the complete opposite of Alfie. He flaunted a pink kimono, sported long hair, and worked as a florist, identifying as gender fluid and pansexual. While Fen's rejection of Alfie's internalized heteronormativity initially spurred Alfie's self-reflection, it became apparent that Fen's resistance against heteronormativity transformed into a means of avoiding life-changing events. Fen's decision to return to his homophobic hometown and work as a florist after his mother's passing highlighted his reliance on passiveness as a defense mechanism.

Throughout the narrative, we witness Alfie's growth as he clumsily grappled with his heteronormativity. However, Fen's character displayed an increasing apathy, even in the face of hate crimes targeting their relationship. When a group of teens vandalized Fen's shop and spewed homophobic slurs, Alfie was outraged and ready to retaliate. But Fen, indifferent to the hate crimes, prevented Alfie from taking action. This moment of passiveness from Fen confused me, as Alfie eventually surrendered to Fen's "be-kind" cliche even after being physically assaulted.

The book also abuses the term "heteronormativity" in the context of their relationship. Fen's passiveness made the relationship almost one-sided. A relationship requires commitment from both sides, but Fen’s passiveness made it almost single-sided. At first, as the primary financial contributor to their relationship, Alfie idealized Fen as the counterpart of a republican housewife. It was entirely justified when Fen criticized Alfie for projecting hetero norms into their power dynamic. Alfie adapted by learning to cook, despite his mother's objections, and took on most of the household chores since Fen struggled with housekeeping. Moreover, Alfie was forced to save the flower shop from financial collapse and ultimately left his job at the London bank. As the imbalance in the relationship grew, it became almost comical to witness Fen continuously accusing Alfie of heteronormativity.

Being gay can be a courageous act of defiance against societal norms. In this regard, Alfie, despite moments of uncertainty, takes control of his destiny by reconstructing his identity in his early 30s. This book is unsettling in its downplaying of Alfie's experiences as an agent of his own destiny and the glorification of Fen's indifference. It's disheartening to witness Alfie's excessive accommodation of Fen's passiveness. Ultimately, Pansies disappointed in its handling of the characters and their respective journeys, painting an imbalanced and unrealistic portrayal of a queer relationship.
